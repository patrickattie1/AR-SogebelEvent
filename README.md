# AR-Sogebel's Open Door Event, Port au Prince, December 2018
Created for the inauguration of the new Sogebel's open space in Port au Prince, Ha√Øti, December 2018

This AR application was designed using Unity and Vuforia.

It is a very basic AR application using only one photo for a video augmentation.

The photo can be found in the Assets\Datafiles\Photos directory and it is called AugmentationPic.png (size ~ 181 kb). This photo is just a plan of the open space that has been inaugurated.
